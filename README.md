# Ranked_Information_Retrieval
I crawled the ana.press site and saved its data in a file and retrieve the sorted list of results using the tf-idf method and cosine criteria for each query.
First run the crawler (main.py) to generate the csv file
then run Ranked_IR.py to print Ranked list with simalarity between query and docs
